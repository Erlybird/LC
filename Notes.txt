1. boolean arrays, the default value is false, but the array itself is initialized to null until you explicitly create the array and assign it a reference

2.  arr = new boolean[H1_Helper][];
        //initialzing with the number of rows, columns have to be instantiated separately for each row
        // arr[i][j] represents an array with ith row and jth column

3. In binary search the initialization of mid variable should be inside the while loop of (left <= right)

4. Binary Search: if we are able to reduce the search space by half always without exception or increase the search space by 2x

5. In Search in 2D sorted Matrix: mid element is found out by dividing the mid number with the no. of columns because we can know the row number only when we know the number of columns.
