1. boolean arrays, the default value is false, but the array itself is initialized to null until you explicitly create the array and assign it a reference

2.  arr = new boolean[H1_Helper][];
        //initialzing with the number of rows, columns have to be instantiated separately for each row
        // arr[i][j] represents an array with ith row and jth column

3. In binary search the initialization of mid variable should be inside the while loop of (left <= right)

4. Binary Search: if we are able to reduce the search space by half always without exception or increase the search space by 2x

5. In Search in 2D sorted Matrix: mid element is found out by dividing the mid number with the no. of columns because we can know the row number only when we know the number of columns.

6. primes[(int)(c-'a')] - will give the integer value of difference of ASCII values of char c and 'a', but , you can directly write it as primes[c-'a']

7. In the problem containing products and you don't know how big the number could be use Double instead of Integer, because Integer may go out of bounds and may not give the results as expected.

8. List<List<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>(); - initiate like this for ArrayList<Arraylist<Integer>>
